# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

The original purpose of this project was to provide an indepth analysis of the school distrtict to help show a realtionship between school spending and passing rates. However, in the process of doing the analysis it was discovered that there might be instances of academic fraud. The ninth grade students of Thomas High School were found to be cheating and the grades associated with those 1,174 students needed to be taken out of the final analysis.

## Results

By running the analysis again before we adjust the THS number to only reflect the 10th, 11th, 12th grade students we see a drop in each catergory that THS falls into.
  -We see THS fall off the top 5 list.

  -We see a decrease in the spending catergory by school.

When we replace the scores for THS by only using the grades from the 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students we see very little change in the scores.

## Summary
By replacing the scores of THS with only the grades of the 10th, 11th, and 12th graders we see no substantial changes to the rest of the district as a whole. Passing rates by school size and type see no appreciable differences. The is a small decrease in the 9th grade scores in the overall district by grade. However by running the district analysis before replacing the scores of THS with the upperlassmen grades we see a big shift in all the catergories. By dropping the grades of the THS 9th graders we get an unskewed assessment of the distirct so that we can look at the report without making future decisions based on the scewed reports.

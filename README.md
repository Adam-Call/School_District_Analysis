# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

The original purpose of this project was to provide an indepth analysis of the school distrtict to help show a realtionship between school spending and passing rates. However, in the process of doing the analysis it was discovered that there might be instances of academic fraud. The ninth grade students of Thomas High School were found to be cheating and the grades associated with those 1,174 students needed to be taken out of the final analysis.

## Results

After rerunning the analysis after removing the grades for the 9th grade students at THS we see a very small change in the district summary. In a district of 39,170 students the actual number of students being replaced from THS is only 3% of the total student population, this could explain the small change in the overall passing rates.

In the summary of THS we see significant drops in each of the passing rates. Then by replaceing the grades with only the 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students we see the grades bounce back up.

## Summary
By replacing the scores of THS with only the grades of the 10th, 11th, and 12th graders we see no substantial changes to the rest of the district as a whole. Passing rates by school size and type see no appreciable differences. The is a small decrease in the 9th grade sacores in the overall district by grade. The biggest change in the reporting we saw was when comparing THS scores before and after the replacement of grades. Since we replaced the THS grades at the district level with the grades of studnets not in the ninth grade we kept the analysis unskewed by the discovery of academic fraud.
